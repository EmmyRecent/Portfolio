              Hey there! My name is <span>Chukwuemeka</span>, but you can call
              me <span>Emmy</span> â€” because why not? ðŸ˜Š Everyone does!
            </p>

            <p>
              My journey into programming started in 2020 when I experimented
              with my first <span>block-based language</span>, Scratch. Funny,
              right? At the time, I had no idea this curiosity would turn into a
              full-fledged passion for coding.
            </p>

            <p>
              From secondary school to college, Iâ€™ve navigated the tech world as
              both a self-taught developer and a computing student. Along the
              way, Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects that sharpened my expertise
              in web and mobile development. With a strong foundation in{" "}
              <span>JavaScript, React</span>, and{" "}
              <span>full-stack technologies,</span> Iâ€™m always pushing
              boundaries to create innovative, user-focused solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether itâ€™s building dynamic applications, optimising
              performance, or crafting seamless user experiences, I love turning
              ideas into reality.
            </p>
